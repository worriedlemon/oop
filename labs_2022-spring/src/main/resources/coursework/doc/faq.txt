Kotlin JPaint (c:) FAQ

1. Using Program

In the main window there are 3 panels:
1) The biggest one is basically a canvas, where you draw your fantasies with Left Mouse Button
2) On the left side there is a selection menu, where brush, bucket, shapes and colors can be chosen:
  - first button is brush tool
  - second button is filler tool - bucket, which can fill closed contours (or all painting are if there are none) with Fill Color
  - third button is shape chooser, where you can choose a shape to draw between rectangle, oval and straight line
  - fourth button represent Outline Color Chooser
  - fifth button represent Fill Color Chooser
  - also you can use Eraser tool by drawing with Right Mouse Button

3) Above there is a toolbar, where thickness of drawing components can be tweaked, which are:
  - brush thickness - size of brush tip
  - eraser thickness - size of area to be erased
  - outline thickness - width of the shape border

To save your masterpiece go to menu and click File - Save.
Also you can Undo/Redo changes by clicking Edit - Undo/Redo.

2. Hot keys
- Shift    - activate "right" mode
   Tip: all shapes will be right, e.g:
   - rectangle will become square;
   - oval will become circle;
   - lines will be aligned by right angle or by 45 degrees (depends on line direction)

- Ctrl + S - saving image
- Ctrl + Z - undo
- Ctrl + Y - redo
